## Auth

| path | method | purpose |
|:----|:-------|:--------|
| /api/v1/auth    | POST   | Email registration. Requires **`email`**, **`password`**, and **`password_confirmation`** params. A verification email will be sent to the email address provided. Accepted params can be customized using the [`devise_parameter_sanitizer`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#strong-parameters) system. |
| /api/v1/auth | DELETE | Account deletion. This route will destroy users identified by their **`uid`**, **`access_token`** and **`client`** headers. |
| /api/v1/auth | PUT | Account updates. This route will update an existing user's account settings. The default accepted params are **`password`** and **`password_confirmation`**, but this can be customized using the [`devise_parameter_sanitizer`](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#strong-parameters) system. If **`config.check_current_password_before_update`** is set to `:attributes` the **`current_password`** param is checked before any update, if it is set to `:password` the **`current_password`** param is checked only if the request updates user password. |
| /api/v1/auth/sign_in | POST | Email authentication. Requires **`email`** and **`password`** as params. This route will return a JSON representation of the `User` model on successful login along with the `access-token` and `client` in the header of the response. |
| /api/v1/auth/sign_out | DELETE | Use this route to end the user's current session. This route will invalidate the user's authentication token. You must pass in **`uid`**, **`client`**, and **`access-token`** in the request headers. |
| /api/v1/auth/:provider | GET | Set this route as the destination for client authentication. Ideally this will happen in an external window or popup. |
| /api/v1/auth/:provider/callback | GET/POST | Destination for the oauth2 provider's callback uri. `postMessage` events containing the authenticated user's data will be sent back to the main client window from this page. |
| /api/v1/auth/validate_token | GET | Use this route to validate tokens on return visits to the client. Requires **`uid`**, **`client`**, and **`access-token`** as params. These values should correspond to the columns in your `User` table of the same names. |
| /api/v1/auth/password | POST | Use this route to send a password reset confirmation email to users that registered by email. Accepts **`email`** and **`redirect_url`** as params. The user matching the `email` param will be sent instructions on how to reset their password. `redirect_url` is the url to which the user will be redirected after visiting the link contained in the email. |
| /api/v1/auth/password | PUT | Use this route to change users' passwords. Requires **`password`** and **`password_confirmation`** as params. This route is only valid for users that registered by email (OAuth2 users will receive an error). It also checks **`current_password`** if **`config.check_current_password_before_update`** is not set `false` (disabled by default). |
| /api/v1/auth/password/edit | GET | Verify user by password reset token. This route is the destination URL for password reset confirmation. This route must contain **`reset_password_token`** and **`redirect_url`** params. These values will be set automatically by the confirmation email that is generated by the password reset request. |
| **Zones**    |    | |
| /api/v1/zones    | GET   | You can get the collections of zones. Example **`[{"id":"6e940df0-a13c-4177-a535-3e01ccee63fb","name":"zona1","created_at":"2017-02-08T04:05:15.444Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T04:05:15.444Z","coordinator_id":null},{"id":"101a8435-2ce3-4e01-ad23-e53916e611cb","name":"zona2","created_at":"2017-02-08T04:56:00.188Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T04:56:00.188Z","coordinator_id":null}]`**|
| **Sections**    |    | |
| /api/v1/sections| GET <br /> **params:** `zone_id: optional`   | You can get the collection of sections. Example: **`[{"id":"be7124eb-7a51-40ee-96dc-201c66b72d7f","name":"seccion1","zone_id":"6e940df0-a13c-4177-a535-3e01ccee63fb","created_at":"2017-02-08T04:05:31.548Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T04:05:31.548Z","coordinator_id":null},{"id":"abb4a3cc-c27c-4852-9c79-318fc099c455","name":"sectiondezona1-2","zone_id":"6e940df0-a13c-4177-a535-3e01ccee63fb","created_at":"2017-02-12T17:53:19.567Z","updated_at":"2017-02-12T17:53:19.567Z","coordinator_id":null}]`**|
